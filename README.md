# Snake-Water-Gun-Game

This Python program is a simple game that simulates a version of Rock-Paper-Scissors, using "Snake," "Water," and "Gun" as the choices. The user inputs their choice, and the computer randomly selects one of the three options. The game then determines the winner based on predefined rules.

## Features:
- User inputs their choice: `s` for Snake, `w` for Water, and `g` for Gun.
- The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
- The game determines the result based on the rules:
  - Snake beats Water
  - Water beats Gun
  - Gun beats Snake
- The game provides feedback on whether the user won, lost, or if it was a draw.

## How to Play:
1. Run the script.
2. Enter your choice when prompted (`s` for Snake, `w` for Water, `g` for Gun).
3. The computer's choice will be displayed, and the outcome of the game will be shown.
